# Heartbeat checklist

## Inbox & messages
- Scan inbox for anything urgent or time-sensitive
- Check for messages that have been waiting > 2 hours without a reply

## Monitoring
- Verify production services are healthy (check status page / uptime endpoint)
- Check if any CI/CD pipelines are failing on main branch
- Look for open PRs that have been approved but not merged

## Tasks & follow-ups
- Review open tasks for approaching deadlines (next 24 hours)
- Flag any blocked items and note what's needed to unblock them

## Alerts
- Only alert if something genuinely needs attention right now
- For non-urgent items, batch them into the next check-in
- If daytime and nothing pending, send a brief "all clear" check-in
